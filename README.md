# Orky
## What is Orky?
Orky is an application built for [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software). It consists of a Bot that forwards messages to OrkyBots (script executors that speak the Orky protocol).

## What is a Script Executor/OrkyBot?
A script executor or OrkyBot as I call it is any service that speaks the Orky protocol and can execute some piece of functionality based on chat input.

The most popular script executor for Orky is [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) with the [Hubot-Orky](https://github.com/MattSFT/Orky/tree/master/Hubot-Orky) adapter.
